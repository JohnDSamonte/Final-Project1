                <p>Alternative energies, AKA renewable energies are different energies sourced from renewable resources, Here are some types of Alternative Energy:</p>
                <p>Solar Energy: This is harnessed from the sun using solar panels. It's one of the most well-known and widely used forms of renewable energy. Solar power can be used for electricity, heating, and even cooling. It is widely available in online hsops and some hardware stores.</p>
                <p>Wind Energy: Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy from wind into electrical power. Wind energy is one of the cleanest and most sustainable sources of energy. It is one of the oldest forms of energy being used globally.</p>
                <p>Hydropower: This involves generating electricity by using water flow, typically from dams. Hydropower is the largest source of renewable energy worldwide.</p>
                <p>Geothermal Energy: This is derived from the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. Geothermal plants can provide a constant and reliable source of power. Unfortunately you it is not available for private use for most people.</p>
                <p>Biomass Energy: Biomass energy comes from organic materials like plant and animal waste. It can be used for heating, electricity, and as a fuel for transportation.</p>
                <p>Tidal Energy: This type of energy is generated from the movement of tides. It's a relatively new technology but has great potential due to the predictability of tides.</p>
                <p>These renewable energy sources are crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. They also offer benefits such as job creation, energy security, and reduced dependence on fossil fuels.</p>

            <h3>Benefits of Alternative Energy:</h3>
            <article>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Benefits:</strong> Renewable energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gases during operation, significantly lowering the carbon footprint compared to fossil fuels.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Benefits:</strong> The renewable energy sector creates numerous jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Benefits:</strong> Less air and water pollution from renewable energy sources can lead to fewer health issues such as respiratory problems and cardiovascular diseases. This can inturn give less effects in the long-term</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Benefits:</strong> The push for renewable energy drives technological advancements, leading to more efficient and cost-effective energy solutions. As well as more available forms of energy.</li>
              </ul>
